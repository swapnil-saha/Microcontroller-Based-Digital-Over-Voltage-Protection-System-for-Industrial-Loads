# Microcontroller-Based-Digital-Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads

This resperitory contains the simulation code and circuit design of the project **Microcontroller-Based-Digital-Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads**.

# Summary

The project designed, focuses on the protection of a 3-phase power system in the event of an voltage overload. In industrial power applications, overvoltage is a serious concern that needs to be addressed quite quickly in order to minimize damage. Our project focuses on the implementation of such as a system, that will protect industrial equipment in an over-voltage condition. Based on some necessary assumptions, restrictions and industry-grade emulation, we designed a micro-controller based system to successfully carry out our objectives.
