# Microcontroller-Based-Digital-Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads

This resperitory contains the simulation code and circuit design of the project **Microcontroller-Based-Digital-Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads**.

# Summary of the Project 

This project focuses on the protection of a 3-phase power system in the event of an voltage overload. In industrial power applications, overvoltage is a serious concern that needs to be addressed quite quickly in order to minimize damage. Our project focuses on the implementation of such as a system, that will protect industrial equipment in an over-voltage condition. Based on some necessary assumptions, restrictions and industry-grade emulation, we designed a micro-controller based system to successfully carry out our objectives.

# Contens
- [Ardunio_code](https://github.com/swapnil-saha/Microcontroller-Based-Digital-Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads/tree/main/Ardunio_code) stores the ardunio file code to run the circuit of proteus file.
- [Proteus file](https://github.com/swapnil-saha/Microcontroller-Based-Digital-Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads/tree/main/Proteus%20file) contains 2 protus file. One is with Ardunio Uno as microcontroller and onther one is with intel 8086 as microcontroller.
